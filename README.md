Created solo using Unreal Engine 4 for BenBonk Game Jam #2.  The theme was Limited Space.
Caved In is a 3D top-down survival game where the goal is to blast your way out of a caved-in room before you become completely trapped.  Swing your pickaxe and activate detonators to reach your freedom.

STORY

You're working in the mines one day when a set of earthquakes shakes everything up.  A large boulder falls and blocks your exit, trapping you inside and forcing you to improvise.  Good thing you have your trusty pickaxe.
You'll need to act fast as the room is small and constant earthquakes cause rocks to fall from above.  Slowly chip away at the boulder with your pickaxe.  If you're lucky, an old red detonator will fall and you can activate it to deal massive damage to the boulder.  Don't let the room get too full or rocks might block your path.
Beware!  The darker rocks are too strong to break with your pickaxe so just ignore them.  If the room becomes completely filled with rocks then you will be trapped forever!

CONTROLS / GAMEPLAY
